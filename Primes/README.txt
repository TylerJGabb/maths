This project is mainly concerned with prime numbers and developing
fast algorithms for factoring them. 

The original function which found the largest prime factor was removed. It is the immediate goal
of this project to write a function to return the unique prime factorization of a number.

Although Python is not the right language for trying to write FAST algorithms to do this,
if I can find a way to impliment it in python, moving to a faster language will be easier.
