This project is mainly concerned with prime numbers and developing
fast algorithms for factoring them. 

*Met goal of adding Unique prime facoritazion function
NEXT GOAL: find largest prime factor the fastest way in python

Although Python is not the right language for trying to write FAST algorithms to do this,
if I can find a way to impliment it in python, moving to a faster language will be easier.
